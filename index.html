    <h2>What Is PDE?</h2>

    <p>
      PDE is a private decision environment that functions as a state layer for decisions and commitments.
      It sits upstream of planning, KPIs, and execution, and exists to produce decision coherence so intent
      does not drift, contradict itself, or disappear over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most organizations optimize execution and measurement. PDE focuses on the layer before those systems
      engage, where intent is formed, commitments are made, and assumptions are fixed. By making that layer
      explicit, durable, and reviewable, coordination becomes structural rather than conversational.
    </p>

    <p>
      PDE is built as decision infrastructure, not a thinking aid. A secondary effect is that patterns
      become visible. When commitments persist and are revisited against reality, recurring behaviors,
      blind spots, and judgment errors surface on their own. This is not reflection for its own sake.
      It is operational pattern recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outcome is not abstract personal development. It is improved performance under pressure.
      Decisions conclude faster. Reversals become intentional rather than chaotic. Attention shifts to
      what actually changes results.
    </p>

    <p>
      PDE does not coach, motivate, or interpret. It provides the rails that high-level performance already
      requires: explicit intent, durable commitments, and review against reality. Clarity emerges because
      unresolved decision state is no longer allowed to persist.
